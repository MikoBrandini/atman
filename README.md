# atman
This was my first attempt at creating a website for my prework before starting General Assembly. 
<br>
It's promoting the website of a fictional dystopic conglomerate called @man.
<br>
They just released jewelry which change color depending on one's mood. <br>
All based on our cranial implants, of course. <br>
